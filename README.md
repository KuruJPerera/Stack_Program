Stack in Python:

This project showcases a simple but important data structure known as a stack. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item added is the first one to be removed. It’s commonly used in applications like undo features, expression parsing, and managing function calls.

What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure where elements are added and removed from the top only. You "push" an item onto the stack to add it, and "pop" it to remove it. This behavior mimics real-life stacks — like plates or boxes — where only the topmost item is accessible.
Stacks are widely used in programming due to their simplicity and usefulness. In Python, they are often implemented using lists.

How the Stack Works:

This script defines two main operations:
push(stack, item): Adds an item to the top of the stack using Python’s append() method.
pop(stack): Removes and returns the top item using pop(). If the stack is empty, it returns None.
These operations reflect the core LIFO behavior of a stack and help demonstrate how the structure works.

Getting Started: Requirements:

To use this project, you’ll need:

. Python 3 installed on your computer

. A way to run Python scripts (any basic code editor or IDE will work)

. Familiarity with how to open and run Python files

. If you don’t have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website:
